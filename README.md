## üèÉ Project Management

During the initial phase, which spanned approximately four weeks, our dedicated team of two members successfully completed phase 1 of this project. This phase laid the foundation for our platform, but we're not stopping there. We're excited to announce that we're planning to introduce additional features and enhancements in phase 2 and beyond.
